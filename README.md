What Can You Do With This App?

I've split the app into three simple tools:

1. ðŸ“Š Stock Analysis 

2. ðŸ”® Stock Prediction

3. ðŸ’¹ CAPM Analysis

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project is organized in a modular way that is easy to understand and maintain. This is the standard structure for a multi-page Streamlit application.
