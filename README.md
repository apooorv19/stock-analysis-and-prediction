What Can You Do With This App?

I've split the app into three simple tools:

1. ðŸ“Š Stock Analysis 

2. ðŸ”® Stock Prediction

3. ðŸ’¹ CAPM Analysis

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project is organized in a modular way that is easy to understand and maintain. This is the standard structure for a multi-page Streamlit application.

```
trading-app/
â”‚â”€â”€ Trading_App.py              # Main homepage of the app
â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt            # List of necessary Python libraries
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/                      # Contains all app pages
